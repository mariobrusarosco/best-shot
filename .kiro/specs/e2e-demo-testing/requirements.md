# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature establishes comprehensive end-to-end (E2E) testing for the Best Shot application, specifically targeting the demo environment at https://best-shot-demo.mariobrusarosco.com. The goal is to create automated tests that validate critical user workflows and ensure the application functions correctly from a user's perspective across different scenarios.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a QA engineer, I want automated E2E tests for the demo environment, so that I can validate critical user workflows without manual testing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the E2E test suite is executed THEN the system SHALL test against the demo environment URL https://best-shot-demo.mariobrusarosco.com
2. WHEN tests are run THEN the system SHALL validate core user workflows including navigation, authentication, and primary features
3. WHEN tests complete THEN the system SHALL provide clear pass/fail results with detailed error reporting
4. WHEN tests fail THEN the system SHALL capture screenshots and logs for debugging purposes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want E2E tests that cover authentication flows, so that I can ensure users can properly log in and access protected features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication tests run THEN the system SHALL test successful login scenarios
2. WHEN authentication tests run THEN the system SHALL test failed login scenarios with invalid credentials
3. WHEN authentication tests run THEN the system SHALL test logout functionality
4. WHEN authentication tests run THEN the system SHALL verify protected routes are properly secured

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a product owner, I want E2E tests that validate core application features, so that I can ensure the main user journeys work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN feature tests run THEN the system SHALL test primary navigation between pages
2. WHEN feature tests run THEN the system SHALL test data loading and display functionality
3. WHEN feature tests run THEN the system SHALL test user interactions with forms and controls
4. WHEN feature tests run THEN the system SHALL test responsive behavior across different viewport sizes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want E2E tests that can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines, so that I can automatically validate deployments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN E2E tests are configured THEN the system SHALL support headless browser execution for CI environments
2. WHEN E2E tests are configured THEN the system SHALL generate test reports in standard formats (JUnit, HTML)
3. WHEN E2E tests are configured THEN the system SHALL support parallel test execution for faster feedback
4. WHEN E2E tests fail in CI THEN the system SHALL preserve artifacts (screenshots, videos, logs) for analysis

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want E2E test configuration that's maintainable and extensible, so that I can easily add new tests as features are developed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN test configuration is set up THEN the system SHALL use page object model pattern for maintainable test structure
2. WHEN test configuration is set up THEN the system SHALL provide reusable utilities for common test operations
3. WHEN test configuration is set up THEN the system SHALL support environment-specific configuration (demo, staging, production)
4. WHEN new tests are added THEN the system SHALL provide clear patterns and examples for test creation
