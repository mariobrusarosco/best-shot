# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Development Commands

**Package Manager**: Use `yarn` for all package management (not npm)

### Core Development
- `yarn dev` - Start development server in local-dev mode
- `yarn dev-demo` - Start development server in demo mode
- `yarn dev-staging` - Start development server in staging mode
- `yarn dev-prod` - Start development server in production mode
- `yarn start` - Start both frontend and backend servers concurrently
- `yarn build` - TypeScript compilation and production build

### Code Quality (Biome.js + TypeScript)
- `yarn lint` - Run Biome linting
- `yarn lint:fix` - Run Biome linting with auto-fix
- `yarn format` - Run Biome formatting
- `yarn format:fix` - Run Biome formatting with auto-fix
- `yarn typecheck` - Run TypeScript type checking only
- `yarn check` - Run both linting/formatting AND TypeScript type checking
- `yarn check:fix` - Auto-fix linting/formatting issues AND run type checking

**IMPORTANT**: Always run `yarn check` before considering any development task complete. This ensures both code quality and TypeScript type safety.

### Testing
- `yarn test` - Run tests with coverage using Vitest
- `yarn test:dev` - Run tests in watch mode

### Package Management
- `yarn add <package>` - Add dependencies
- `yarn add -D <package>` - Add dev dependencies

## Architecture Overview

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Routing**: TanStack Router with file-based routing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state, React context for app state
- **Styling**: Material-UI v7 with custom theme and styled components
- **Testing**: Vitest with Testing Library and Playwright for E2E
- **Build Tool**: Vite with custom plugins

### Project Structure
The codebase follows a domain-driven structure under `src/domains/`:

- `authentication/` - Auth0 and bypass authentication adapters
- `dashboard/` - Main dashboard with cards and performance metrics
- `tournament/` - Tournament management, standings, and match handling
- `league/` - League creation, customization, and participant management  
- `match/` - Match cards, scoring, and guess functionality
- `member/` - User profile and account management
- `guess/` - Prediction/guessing system with validation
- `ui-system/` - Reusable UI components and design system

### Key Patterns

**Environment-based Configuration**: The app uses environment modes (`local-dev`, `demo`, `staging`, `production`) to switch between Auth0 and bypass authentication via the adapter pattern in `src/domains/authentication/index.ts`.

**Domain Isolation**: Each domain has its own structure:
- `components/` - React components
- `hooks/` - Domain-specific React hooks  
- `server-side/` - API fetchers and mutations
- `typing.ts` - TypeScript interfaces and types

**Routing**: Uses TanStack Router with:
- File-based routing in `src/routes/`
- Auth-protected routes under `_auth/`
- Layout-based nesting for complex pages

**Styling**: Material-UI with custom theme at `src/theming/theme.ts` defining:
- Custom color palette (teal, black, neutral, etc.)
- Typography using Poppins/Montserrat fonts
- Responsive breakpoints (mobile: 768px, tablet: 769px, laptop: 1024px, desktop: 1440px)

**State Management**: 
- TanStack Query for server state with custom configuration
- React Router context for auth state
- No global state management library - uses React patterns

**Import Aliases**:
- Always use absolute imports with aliases like `@domains`, `@components`, etc.

### Form Handling
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with TypeScript integration for form state and validation
- **Components**: Reusable form components in `src/domains/ui-system/components/form/`
  - `AppFormInput` - Text inputs with custom styling and validation
  - `AppFormSelect` - Dropdown selects with options
  - `AppFormCheckbox` - Checkbox inputs with custom styling
  - `AppFormFieldArray` - Dynamic arrays of form fields
  - `AppFormScoreInput` - Sports-specific dual score inputs
- **Validation**: Zod schemas with `@hookform/resolvers/zod` for runtime validation
- **Patterns**: See guides 0005 (React Hook Form) and 0006 (Zod Validation) for implementation details

### Validation
Uses Zod schemas extensively for runtime validation, particularly in tournament and API layers.

### Testing
- Unit tests: Vitest with jsdom environment
- E2E tests: Playwright with tests in `e2e/` directory
- Test setup in `vitest.setup.ts`

### ADR 

- ADRs (Architectural Decision Records) are stored in `docs/adr/` directory, documenting key decisions like:
  - Use of TanStack Router
  - Choice of Material-UI for styling
  - Domain-driven structure

- ADRs are written in Markdown format and start with a unique ID (e.g., `0001-use-tanstack-router.md`).

### Plans
- Plans are stored in `docs/plans/` directory, outlining future features and improvements.
- Each plan is a Markdown file with a unique ID (e.g., `0001-add-league-management.md`).
- Use Decision Matrix to evaluate options.

### Guides
- Guides are stored in `docs/guides/` directory, providing best practices and usage examples
- Guide are made to help other developers understand how to use the codebase effectively.
- Each guide is a Markdown file with a unique ID (e.g., `0001-creating-a-screen.md`).
- Use Decision Matrix to explain when and how to use specific features or components.
