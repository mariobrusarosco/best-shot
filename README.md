# Best Shot

A side project _Football App_ where I intend to:

1. Simulate a real world app, as much as possible. The goal is to validate premises and get a closer feeling about the pros anb cons regarding front end patterns, tools and frameworks.

2. Use it as part of my _portfolio_ so I can demonstrate _some_ skills and tools I've learnt.
