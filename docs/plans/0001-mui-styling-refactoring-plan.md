# Plan 0001: MUI Styling Architecture Refactoring

## Overview

This plan outlines a comprehensive, systematic refactoring of the Best Shot application to implement our research-based MUI styling architecture. The goal is to migrate from mixed styling patterns to a consistent, performant approach using **2 core patterns**: Static Styled Components and Dynamic sx Prop.

## üìä Current State Analysis

### ‚úÖ Strengths Found
- **Strong foundation**: Comprehensive theme system with design tokens in `/src/domains/ui-system/theme/`
- **Modern MUI v7**: Already upgraded to latest version with breaking changes resolved
- **Domain structure**: UI system properly organized with base components
- **Some consistency**: Base components like `AppButton` exist and follow good patterns

### üîç Issues Identified

#### Mixed Styling Patterns
- **Static Styled Components**: Found in `AIPredictionButton.tsx`, `match-card.styles.tsx`, `menu/styles.tsx`
- **sx prop usage**: Found in 15+ files for layout and quick customizations
- **Separate styles files**: 6 files with dedicated `.styles.tsx` files that should be consolidated

#### Inconsistent Component Usage
- Some components using `styled()` directly instead of base components
- Theme access inconsistency: `theme.palette.teal[500]` vs design tokens
- Missing base components for common UI patterns

#### Architecture Gaps  
- Incomplete UI system with missing base components
- Scattered styling logic across separate files
- No enforcement of styling patterns

### üìÅ Files Requiring Migration

#### Immediate Priority (Core UI System):
- `/src/domains/ai/components/AIPredictionButton.tsx` - Good static styled pattern, needs token consistency
- `/src/domains/match/components/match-card/match-card.styles.tsx` - Separate styles file to consolidate
- `/src/domains/global/components/menu/styles.tsx` - Separate styles file to consolidate  
- `/src/domains/ui-system/components/*` - Complete base component system

#### Secondary Priority (Domain Components):
- 15+ files using sx prop patterns - Audit and standardize
- Tournament, League, Match domain components
- Layout and navigation components

## üìö Implementation Guidelines

### For Each Migration Task:

#### Before Starting:
1. **Read the component** and understand current styling approach
2. **Identify reusable patterns** that could become base components  
3. **Check theme token usage** and plan migration to design system tokens
4. **Review responsive behavior** and plan sx prop usage

#### During Migration:
1. **Follow the 2-pattern decision matrix** from the styling guide
2. **Use Static Styled Components** for reusable, cross-domain components
3. **Use Dynamic sx prop** for one-off styles, layout, and responsive values
4. **Test accessibility** and responsive behavior
5. **Update TypeScript interfaces** for consistency

#### After Migration:
1. **Update component documentation** with new usage patterns
2. **Add to component library** if it's a new base component
3. **Test visual regression** to ensure no UI breaking changes
4. **Update related components** that might be affected

### Code Review Checklist:
- [ ] Component follows either Static Styled or Dynamic sx pattern
- [ ] No inline styled() creation in render functions  
- [ ] Theme tokens used instead of hardcoded values
- [ ] Responsive values use object syntax for sx prop
- [ ] TypeScript interfaces properly defined
- [ ] Accessibility considerations addressed
- [ ] Component documentation updated
